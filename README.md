# Jonathan Morris - Resume Repo
I have included some example projects in this repo. All these code is my own work. The following projects are included:
* Example Aura Components.
* An example org that includes custom Apex classes, Visualforce pages, Triggers, and Lightning components. Most of these were created as a result of taking Trailhead modules.
* Example Lightning Web Components.
* SOAP and REST-based endpoints and callouts.
* A Web-To-Lead form I designed for another company. This is currently connected to my own developer org for demonstration purposes and is fully functional.
* A basic web application I designed. This is connected to my own developer org.
