# Jonathan Morris - Resume Repo
I have included some example custom-coded projects in this repo. All these projects were created from scratch and are my own work. The following projects are included:
* An example org that includes custom Apex classes, Visualforce pages, Triggers, and Lightning components. Most of these were created as a result of taking Trailhead modules.
* A Salesforce-integrated web application I designed for a company. This is currently connected to my own developer org for demonstration purposes and is fully functional.
* A Web-To-Lead form I designed for another company. This is also connected to my own developer org.
